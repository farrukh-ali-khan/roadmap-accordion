# Accordion Component

This is a simple accordion component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a list of questions or headings, and when a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer or content section expands while collapsing any previously opened section. This ensures only one section is open at a time, keeping the UI clean and organized.

## Requirements

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation

## Features

- Only one section is expanded at a time.
- Simple and responsive design.
- Easy to modify and extend for further functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the accordion and its sections.
- **CSS**: Styling the accordion, including transitions and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handling the DOM manipulation to expand/collapse sections on click.

## How To Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farrukh-ali-khan/roadmap-accordion/
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd roadmap-accordion
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the accordion in action.

## How It Works

The accordion works by toggling the display of content sections upon clicking the respective question or heading. The JavaScript ensures that only one section is expanded at any given time by collapsing other sections before opening the clicked one.
